Global Transaction ID (GTID) Replication support was added during
the Kilo release for MySQL 5.6 and later. The equivalent for MySQL 5.6,
MariaDB 10, has a different implementation of GTID. By creating a similar
strategy implementation we could get support for GTID Replication for the
MariaDB 10 datastore.

Launchpad Blueprint:
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/trove/+spec/mariadb-gtid-replication

Problem Description
===================

In order to create a replica of a MariaDB instance you can only use
binary logs based replication. GTID replication was added as an alternative
for replication for MySQL 5.6, but it's not available
for the equivalent for it, MariaDB 10.

Proposed Change
===============

We would need to create
trove/trove/guestagent/strategies/replication/experimental/mariadb_gtid.py
in order to support replication for MariaDB.

The SQL issued to set a new empty slave server and replicate all of the
master's binlog from the start is as follows [2]_:

.. code-block:: none

    CHANGE MASTER TO master_host="%(host)s", master_port=%(port)s, \
    master_user="%(user)s", master_password="%(password)s", \
    master_use_gtid=current_pos;
    START SLAVE;


By default, the GTID position for a newly installed server is empty,
which makes the slave replicate from the start of the master's binlogs. [3]_
current_pos in the SQL query carries that position.

It doesn't differ too much on what is being done for MySQL [1]_,
but doing a refactoring might not be the best call right now since
it would add unnecessary complexity to the existing strategy.
