Trove still has the downgrade method on its migration files. Following the
cross-project spec https://review.openstack.org/#/c/152337/ we are supposed to
remove the downgrade to avoid data inconsistency, lack of integrity, etc.
This approach was already done in many projects like Keystone, Magnum, Nova
and others [2][3][4][5].

Launchpad Blueprint:
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/trove/+spec/remove-sql-schema-downgrades


Problem Description
===================

Downgrades are not the best idea when thinking about data integrity. A cross
project spec was proposed to start removing downgrades and it was already done
in many projects. We need to delete downgrade from migration files.

Proposed Change
===============

Remove downgrades from migration files and remove the command from
trove-manage.
